# BTC-BOT-OSCN

In order to track private BTC transactions on my Hard Wallet, this simple app can do this work.

Simply feed a `.env` file inside the `app` folder with your Key Api from Telegram.

```
# .env File Example

TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<YOUR-TELEGRAM-TOKEN-HERE>
CHAT_ID=<YOUR-INITIAL-CHAT-WITH-THE-BOT-HERE>
WALLET_ADDRESS=<YOUR-WALLET-HASH>
EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY=<APILAYER-API>
```

If you want to use the conversion feature to USD, you should register at [ApiLayer](http://apilayer.net/)
